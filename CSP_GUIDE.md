# CSP Guide - Reviewing Leave Requests

## Your Role as a CSP

As a Client Success Partner, you review and approve leave requests from your assigned team members before they go to the client and payroll.

---

## How It Works - Automatic Assignment

### ✨ No Manual Assignment Needed!

**When a team member submits a request:**
1. ✅ System automatically assigns it to you (their designated CSP)
2. ✅ You get an in-app notification
3. ✅ Request appears in your "CSP Review" queue
4. ✅ Only YOUR team's requests show up - no clutter!

**You only see requests assigned to you** - the system filters automatically based on your email.

---

## Accessing Your Review Queue

### Step 1: Log into LeavePoint
- Open LeavePoint and log in with your @zimworx.com email

### Step 2: Navigate to CSP Review
- Click **"CSP Review"** in the sidebar
- Or check your notifications

### Step 3: View Your Assigned Requests
- See all pending requests from YOUR team members only
- Requests are automatically filtered to show only your assignments
